<h2>Annex 2 - Service description</h2>
<p>
	Provider is a multi-blockchain Cryptocurrency Wallet provider that stores the users private key of his corresponding blockchain address safely encrypted and split in multiple parts in separate vaults.
	Provider offers the following Services under the specific terms mentioned herein.
</p>
<p>
1. Wallet Services
</p>
Our Wallet Services allow you to perform the following actions:
<ul>
	<li>	1.	You can create a new Wallet or upload a new Wallet;</li>
	<li>	2.	You can manage the functions of your Wallet;</li>
	<li>	3.	You can initiate a Transaction on the corresponding blockchain.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A. Description of the Services</h3>
<b>Private key storage</b>
Assets will remain on the corresponding blockchain. Provider will split the private key into 3 parts, each part is encrypted and stored in a different vault. On top of the normal encryption, Provider will add a pin code so that if an attacker would be able to bypass all different levels of security of Provider, they would still not get hold of all of a user's fund without the pincode.
<p>
	Provider's data is stored on servers held by a third party. The data is protected against access by the third party provider, who is only making available data storage space. Provider shall make back ups on a regular basis. Provider is not responsible for data loss, hacking of the data or inaccessibility of data due to negligence or fault of the third party provider.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Transactions</b>
</p>
<p>
	You will be able to specify your primary address on each blockchain and link it to your contacting ways like mobile phone number and email address. Linking these addresses to contact details will make it possible to use Provider to send Cryptocurrencies to an email address or a mobile phone number in stead of to a blockchain address as Provider makes the translation. You will be able to receive notifications of incoming transfers on its accounts.
	You can make a Transaction by selecting your Wallet, choosing the destination address and the amount and Cryptocurrency You want to transfer and sign with your pincode. Once signed, Provider sends the Transaction to the blockchain.
	To make a Transaction, the third party application can use the Provider API to send the Transaction to Provider. Provider signs the Transaction on behalf of You and sends it back to the calling third party application or puts it on the corresponding blockchain itself, depending on the parameters specified in the API call.
</p>
<p>
<b>API integration</b>
Provider offers API integration with other applications so You can use your Wallets in these applications. These other applications can be for example crypto exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, crypto portfolios,... By using this API integration You will be very flexible in using your Wallets in many applications without the need to specify them over and over again.
</p>
<h3>B. Specific terms related to the Wallet Services</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1.	The Wallet provides functionalities that allows You to store Cryptocurrency and to make  Transactions via instructions to Provider. You must ensure that Your instructions to Provider conform to the applicable rules of the Cryptocurrency.
The only authentic record of a Transaction is its recording in the blockchain associated with the concerned Cryptocurrency. Provider therefore cannot and does not guarantee that the Wallet reflects (any change in) title to or right on any Cryptocurrency.
To be recorded Transactions must be confirmed and recorded in this blockchain. Provider will use its best efforts to have the Transaction initiated by You recorded in this blockchain.
By initiating an instruction for Transaction you are authorizing Provider to submit your Transaction to the relevant Cryptocurrency network for recording on the concerned blockchain. Once a Transaction has been submitted to the relevant network, the network will automatically record or reject the Transaction and neither You or Provider will be able to cancel or otherwise modify your Transaction.
After being submitted for recording in the blockchain associated with the concerned Cryptocurrency a Transaction may be unconfirmed for a period of time. A Transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state.</li>
	<li>2.	The blockchain technology being based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network or database supported by independent third parties, which is not controlled, owned nor operated by Provider, Provider cannot and does not guarantee that Transactions You initiate using the Services shall be confirmed and recorded in the blockchain associated with the concerned Cryptocurrency nor that once stored, they remain on the blockchain. Conflicts between recordings in the blockchain may not be 					excluded as a result of which your Transaction may not or no longer be recorded in the blockchain associated with the concerned Cryptocurrency.
		You bear the risk and consequences of any transaction not being recorded in the blockchain associated with the concerned Cryptocurrency or for any delay or conflicts in recordings, except in case you can prove that such event is attributable to our negligence or fault in which case article 11 is applicable.</li>
	<li>3. 	You choose the Cryptocurrencies to which your Transactions relate as long as they are supported by Provider and the counterparty for your Transaction. You are solely responsible for the Cryptocurrency and counterparty You choose.
You are solely responsible for ensuring all Transaction details are correct, and You should carefully verify all transaction information prior to submitting transaction instructions
To the extent the Transaction is made as counterparty for the delivery of goods or services from a third party, Provider's Services do not cover and Provider undertakes no liability in relation to the delivery, quality or any other aspect of any such goods or service.</li>
	<li>4.	The Services do not imply that Provider stores, sends, or receives Cryptocurrencies. Any transfer that occurs in any Cryptocurrencies occurs on the blockchains associated with the concerned Cryptocurrency and not on a network or database owned, controlled or operated by Provider.</li>
	<li>5.	You are responsible for loss of blockchain objects (including codes or keys, except those under our safeguarding) or Cryptocurrencies. In case of API integration You will make sure that You only share your API key or codes with third party applications you trust and you are responsible for any misuse of such keys or codes.</li>
